# ðŸ•‘ Temporary Blog
This repo has been archived as it has not been updated for quite some time, and was only ever intended to be a temporary blog.
You can create a blog using the same layout by creating an Astro site with the same template!

## Use This Template

```sh
npm create astro@latest -- --template blog
```
